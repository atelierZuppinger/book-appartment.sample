It is in this splendid, well-preserved setting that HEIDI Alpen cheeses are made. Made exclusively in switzerland, our products are the result of MIFROMA’s deep know-how. They are matured, rinsed and cherished until fully ripened. This is how the cheeses develop their intense flavours and authentic character. Although today we may use modern technologies, our passion for fine cheeses is as longstanding as heidi’s tale. Bon appetit !

            AOP, or “Appellation d’Origine Protégée” is a globally recognized and certified guarantee of origin, protected by Swiss law. An indication of a controlled designation of origin, only a handful of premium food products around the world carry the AOP label.
            More than a simple quality seal, AOP helps preserve the livelihood of artisan food producers by ensuring that only these authentic specialty food products — sometimes unique to one location in the world — carry the AOP label. AOP not only helps to safeguard heritage recipes and techniques, but protects the legacy of specialty producers for generations to come.
            If you’re looking for a guarantee of quality, just look for the AOP label.

    title: The Expertise
    header: |
        The secret to a fine cheese is an artful blend of pure, natural origins, quality milk and the skill of a master cheesemaker. MIFROMA has developed its unique cheesemaking know-how for over 50 years, constantly refining its expertise in selecting, maturing and producing cheeses. Once the cheeses have been lovingly crafted in the mountain or ‘local’ villages and cooperative dairies, HEIDI Alpen products are matured in majestic cheese caves that lie deep in the rocky mountainside, where these fine products gently ripen in a temperate, natural environment. It is here that we ensure that the cheeses are regularly washed, checked and turned. 
        Each cheese wheel is scrupulously controlled for quality. 
        Many of the steps required to make these superior cheeses are still carried out by hand, whilst the use of cutting-edge technologies ensures perfect hygiene and quality.

            Traditional methods, 
            modern techniques
        p0: |
            The basic principles of cheese making have remained unchanged over the centuries.
            The production of Swiss cheeses comprises five stages: curdling; pre-cheesing; heating, forming and saline ­bathing; fermenting ripening; and quality control.
            Each of our cheeses is the result of centuries of artisan knowledge and skills married with the most modern of quality control and production technologies. For precision and flavor, many of the stages are carried out by hand, from salting and churning to turning and washing the cheese wheel. All cheese is checked individually by our Master Cheese Makers before it goes on sale. A distinctive feature of MIFROMA cheeses is that many of our products are matured in a vast natural cave in Ursy, a village at the foot of the Alps. It was over 50 years ago that this ancient rocky cavern was transformed into the perfect cheese chamber. Carved from the mountainside over century, the rugged walls of our prized grotto retain high levels of humidity and maintain a constant year-round temperature of 50 to 57.2° F. This ­temperate environment is the ideal place in which to mature our cheeses to perfection.

        p0: |
            This superior-quality cheese owes its unique character to specific production methods. Le Gruyère AOP is prepared from the finest raw milk from cows fed on grass during the summer and hay during the winter. The use of any additives is prohibited.
        p1: |
            Le Gruyère AOP cheesewheels are aged in a natural rocky cavern in Ursy, small Swiss village at the foot of the Alps, for a shorter or longer period, to create a milder or stronger flavour. It is in this exceptional environment that Gruyère AOP acquires its succulent, salty character. During the maturation period, the cheese wheels are regularly turned and washed with salt water. These time-honoured techniques, an extended aging process and the care given to this majestic product, all lend Gruyère AOP its incomparable flavor.

            Some claim that Sbrinz is Switzerland’s oldest cheese, akin to the ‘Caesus Alpinus’ mentioned 2,000 years ago by the Roman poet, Pliny the Elder. Although these intriguing origins cannot be truly verified, we know that today’s Sbrinz dates back to the 16th century. Hailing from the region of Brienz in central Switzerland, this very hard cheese used to be transported to Italy by mule; in return, Italy sent spices and wine along what became the ‘Sbrinz’ trade route.  
        p0: |
            This handcrafted cheese is similar to Parmesan, boasting a rich, pronounced flavor. It owes its hard paste and aromatic profile to a lengthy production process that is still upheld today. 
        p1: |
            Recognized under the AOP “protected origin” label of quality (Appellation d’Origine Protégée), Sbrinz is usually aged for a minimum of 20 months, when it develops its deep character.

        p1: |
            The impeccably fresh un-pasteurized milk is collected straight from the dairy and the use of any additives is prohibited. With its sweet, mild taste, Emmentaler AOP truly is a cheese for the whole family; children will love the characterful holes, whilst chefs will delight in its versatile cooking qualities.

            Tête de Moine AOP (literally “monk’s head”) is a specialty cheese with a history that dates back 800 years and which originates from the Bellelay Abbey in Switzerland’s Bernese Jura region. A unique-tasting cheese with a unique serving style, Tête de Moine AOC is usually pared into rosettes with a special knife, or cut into small savory chunks.

            This particular cheese is commonly eaten in wafer-thin rosettes, which are shaved off the cheese with a device called a Girolle or a Pirouette. These delicate parings enable the full flavor of the cheese to develop, height-ening the tasting pleasure.
